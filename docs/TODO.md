### **💾 Storage Architecture**

#### **Multi-Tier Storage Strategy**
```
Hot Tier (0-30 days):
├── Recent uploads and frequently accessed files
├── Cost: ~$0.0184 per GB/month
└── Access: <1ms latency

Cool Tier (30-365 days):
├── Archived documents with occasional access
├── Cost: ~$0.01 per GB/month
└── Access: <1ms latency

Archive Tier (365+ days):
├── Long-term retention for compliance
├── Cost: ~$0.002 per GB/month
└── Access: 1-5 minutes retrieval time
```

#### **File Type Optimization**
```typescript
const STORAGE_STRATEGIES = {
  PHOTOS: {
    compression: 'webp',
    quality: 85,
    thumbnails: [150, 300, 600],
    maxSize: '5MB',
    retention: '7years',
    tier: 'hot-to-cool'
  },
  MANUALS: {
    compression: 'pdf',
    maxSize: '50MB',
    retention: '10years',
    tier: 'hot-to-archive'
  },
  WARRANTIES: {
    compression: 'none',
    maxSize: '10MB',
    retention: '15years',
    tier: 'hot-to-archive'
  }
}
```

### **🔒 Security & Compliance**

#### **Access Control Matrix**
```typescript
const DOCUMENT_PERMISSIONS = {
  ADMIN: ['read', 'write', 'delete', 'manage', 'export'],
  MANAGER: ['read', 'write', 'delete', 'export'],
  SUPERVISOR: ['read', 'write'],
  CREW: ['read'],
  EXEC: ['read'],
  CITIZEN: ['read'] // Only public documents
}
```

#### **Retention Policies**
- **Safety Documents**: 10 years
- **Maintenance Records**: 7 years
- **Inspection Reports**: 5 years
- **Photos**: 7 years
- **Temporary Files**: 7 days (auto-delete)

### **💰 Cost Optimization Features**

#### **Real-Time Cost Tracking**
