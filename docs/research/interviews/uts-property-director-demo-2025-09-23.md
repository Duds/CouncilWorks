# Aegrid – Learnings Report from Client Demo with Gavan Hutton

**Date:** 23 September 2025
**Attendee:** Gavan Hutton, Director of Property, University of Technology Sydney
**Context:** Former Engineering Facilities Director, Mirvac Eastern Australia

---

## Executive Summary

The first external demo of Aegrid validated core assumptions while surfacing critical gaps. Gavan strongly endorsed the **criticality-first philosophy** and the simplicity of Aegrid’s design. However, he highlighted missing elements that are non-negotiable in commercial property and facilities management: **energy optimisation as a core feature** and **AI-driven optimisation/intelligence built into the system, not bolted on later**.

The session reinforced that Aegrid is on the right track with its Rules and resilience-first approach, but adjustments are needed to strengthen its credibility, expand its domain coverage, and align with industry standards such as **ISO 55000**.

## Key Learnings

### What Resonated

* **Criticality as foundation:** “Criticality is everything.” Aegrid’s Rules directly align with his worldview.
* **Purpose-driven framing:** Assets should always be tied to their “why” and managed by criticality.
* **Simplicity matters:** Keep interfaces and language plain, practical, and usable for crews.
* **Visualisation sells:** Graphs, charts, and gantt views are vital to win over executives and facilities managers.
* **Two-aspect model:** System must span *strategic lifecycle management* (top-down) and *grass-roots asset analysis* (bottom-up).

### Gaps Identified

* **Energy optimisation not integrated:** For property, this is a baseline expectation, not an add-on.
* **AI misunderstood/misframed:** Gavan expects embedded intelligence to optimise equipment, detect anomalies, and predict issues — not just reporting or dashboards.
* **Naming/language missteps:** Overly conceptual feature names (“Risk Rhythm”) risk confusing users.
* **ISO 55000 alignment missing:** Lack of reference to the standard weakens credibility with asset managers and property executives.

## Strengths vs Weaknesses vs Design Adjustments

| **Area**                                | **Strengths**                                                               | **Weaknesses**                                                        | **Design Adjustments**                                                                                                                                                    |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Criticality Framework**               | Rules (Every Asset Has a Purpose, Risk Sets the Rhythm) strongly validated. | None noted.                                                           | Double down: ensure criticality-based asset IDs, dashboards, and reporting are clear.                                                                                     |
| **Simplicity & UX**                     | Clear intent to keep system simple, field-first.                            | Feature naming abstract/confusing (e.g., “Risk Rhythm”).              | Use plain language: “Maintenance Scheduling,” “Critical Assets,” etc.                                                                                                     |
| **Visualisation**                       | Roadmap includes dashboards and GIS views.                                  | Currently underemphasised; Gavan stressed “graphs sell it.”           | Prioritise charts, gantt, and visual reporting in MVP.                                                                                                                    |
| **Energy Management**                   | Currently absent from design.                                               | “Non-negotiable” gap; optimisation is core for property/UTS.          | Add energy metering & optimisation module: integrate with BMS, EMS, IoT. Include energy KPIs.                                                                             |
| **AI / Intelligence**                   | System analytics under design (signal detection, adaptive response).        | Treated as “nice-to-have.” Misaligned with Gavan’s “AI must be core.” | Reframe as “embedded optimisation intelligence.” Build predictive anomaly detection, optimisation engines. Market as AI-powered, implement with mix of ML + optimisation. |
| **ISO 55000 Alignment**                 | Not referenced in design language.                                          | Weakens credibility with professional asset managers.                 | Map Aegrid’s Rules explicitly to ISO 55000 principles (value, alignment, assurance, leadership, improvement).                                                             |
| **Strategic ↔ Operational Integration** | Aegrid already envisions bridging exec dashboards and field data.           | Not yet clearly expressed as “two-aspect” model.                      | Articulate explicitly: Systems Engineering Lifecycle (top-down) + Grass-roots Criticality Analysis (bottom-up).                                                           |
| **APIs / Integration**                  | API-first already in roadmap.                                               | Not strongly emphasised in demo.                                      | Elevate as a core selling point: API-first design for BMS, finance, EMS, ERP integration.                                                                                 |

## Deeper Insight on AI vs Optimisation

* **What Gavan Means by AI:**

  * Continuous optimisation (e.g., chiller profiles).
  * Pattern detection in noisy data.
  * Automated red-flagging and predictive prompts.
* **What This Actually Requires:**

  * Advanced analytics, optimisation algorithms, anomaly detection, possibly machine learning.
  * Not necessarily full “AI” in a generative or general sense.
* **Design Response:**

  * Internally: frame as **optimisation + signal intelligence**.
  * Externally: market as **AI-powered optimisation and anomaly detection** (to align with stakeholder expectations).

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Energy Management:** Add energy metering, optimisation, and carbon tracking as a first-class module.
2. **AI Reframe:** Position Aegrid as embedding intelligence at its core — optimisation, anomaly detection, prediction — not an optional addon.
3. **ISO 55000 Anchor:** Update collateral to reference ISO 55000, showing Aegrid as aligned with industry best practice.
4. **Language Review:** Audit feature names and UI labels; simplify to plain, operational terms.
5. **Visualisation Priority:** Elevate charts, graphs, gantts, and reporting to MVP features.
6. **Two-Aspect Model:** Clearly communicate that Aegrid integrates *strategic lifecycle management* with *grass-roots criticality analysis*.

## Conclusion

This session confirmed Aegrid’s **core philosophy is right** — criticality and purpose-first design resonates deeply with experienced property leaders. However, to expand beyond councils into universities, property portfolios, and owner-operators, Aegrid must **close gaps in energy optimisation, AI framing, and ISO 55000 alignment**. Addressing these areas will significantly strengthen Aegrid’s credibility and market fit.

Would you like me to also **map these design adjustments back to the Aegrid Rules** (showing how energy, AI, ISO alignment can be woven into your existing Rule framework), so it stays consistent with your core philosophy rather than looking like bolt-ons?
