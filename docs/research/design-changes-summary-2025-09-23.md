## Executive Summary

This document summarises the comprehensive design changes made to Aegrid based on feedback from the UTS Property Director demo. The changes address critical gaps in energy management, AI positioning, ISO 55000 compliance, and language simplification while strengthening the platform's credibility and market fit.

## Key Changes Implemented

### 1. Energy Management as Core Feature

**Problem Identified**: Energy optimisation was missing from the design - a "non-negotiable" requirement for property management.

**Changes Made**:
- **New Architecture Document**: Created `docs/architecture/energy-management-module.md`
- **SAD Updates**: Added energy management as core component in system architecture
- **Integration Points**: BMS/EMS connectivity, energy metering, carbon tracking
- **Technical Implementation**: Python services for energy optimisation and analytics

**Files Modified**:
- `docs/architecture/SAD.md` - Added energy management components and integrations
- `docs/architecture/energy-management-module.md` - New comprehensive energy module specification

### 2. AI Intelligence Repositioning

**Problem Identified**: AI was treated as "nice-to-have" rather than core embedded intelligence.

**Changes Made**:
- **New Architecture Document**: Created `docs/architecture/ai-intelligence-module.md`
- **SAD Updates**: Repositioned AI as embedded optimisation intelligence
- **Core Capabilities**: Anomaly detection, predictive maintenance, automated red-flagging
- **Marketing Alignment**: Position as "AI-powered optimisation and anomaly detection"

**Files Modified**:
- `docs/architecture/SAD.md` - Added AI intelligence engine as core component
- `docs/architecture/ai-intelligence-module.md` - New comprehensive AI module specification

### 3. ISO 55000 Compliance Integration

**Problem Identified**: Lack of ISO 55000 reference weakened credibility with professional asset managers.

**Changes Made**:
- **New Compliance Document**: Created `docs/compliance/iso55000-compliance-mapping.md`
- **SAD Updates**: Added ISO 55000 compliance requirements
- **Aegrid Rules Mapping**: Explicit mapping of Aegrid Rules to ISO 55000 principles
- **Implementation Framework**: Comprehensive compliance implementation guide

**Files Modified**:
- `docs/architecture/SAD.md` - Added ISO 55000 compliance requirements and mapping
- `docs/compliance/iso55000-compliance-mapping.md` - New comprehensive compliance specification

### 4. Language Simplification

**Problem Identified**: Feature names like "Risk Rhythm" were abstract and confusing.

**Changes Made**:
- **UX Plan Updates**: Simplified all feature names to plain operational terms
- **Navigation Structure**: Updated journey-centric navigation with clear language
- **Terminology Mapping**: Documented before/after language changes

**Files Modified**:
- `docs/architecture/journey-centric-ux-plan.md` - Added language simplification section

### 5. Enhanced Visualisation Priority

**Problem Identified**: Visualisation was underemphasised - "graphs sell it" for executives.

**Changes Made**:
- **UX Plan Updates**: Prioritised charts, graphs, and visual reporting as MVP features
- **Dashboard Enhancements**: Added enhanced visualisation requirements
- **Executive Focus**: Emphasised visual reporting for executive buy-in

**Files Modified**:
- `docs/architecture/journey-centric-ux-plan.md` - Added enhanced visualisation priority section
- `docs/architecture/SAD.md` - Updated frontend to include enhanced visualisation

### 6. Two-Aspect Model Articulation

**Problem Identified**: Need to clearly express strategic lifecycle management + grass-roots criticality analysis.

**Changes Made**:
- **Architecture Documentation**: Clarified the two-aspect model in system design
- **User Journey Mapping**: Explicitly articulated both strategic and operational perspectives
- **Integration Points**: Documented how both aspects work together
