### 4. Basic Asset CRUD API Endpoints ✅

**Objective**: Implement RESTful API for asset management operations.

**Implementation**:
- `GET /api/assets` - List assets with filtering, search, and pagination
- `GET /api/assets/[id]` - Get individual asset with relationships
- `POST /api/assets` - Create new assets with spatial data
- `PUT /api/assets/[id]` - Update existing assets with validation
- `DELETE /api/assets/[id]` - Delete assets (admin only)

**API Features**:
- Role-based access control (MANAGER+ for CRUD, ADMIN for delete)
- Comprehensive input validation using Zod schemas
- Spatial data handling for latitude/longitude coordinates
- Audit logging for all operations
- Error handling and user-friendly messages

- Location: PostGIS Point geometry, address, suburb, postcode, state, country
- Asset Details: manufacturer, model, serialNumber, installationDate, warrantyExpiry
- Financial: purchasePrice, currentValue, replacementCost, depreciationRate
- Maintenance: lastInspection, nextInspection, inspectionFrequency, maintenanceCost
- Metadata: tags, notes, isPublic, audit fields

**Relationships**:
- Organisation (many-to-one)
- User (createdBy, updatedBy)
- AssetDocument (one-to-many)
- AssetInspection (one-to-many)
- AssetMaintenance (one-to-many)
