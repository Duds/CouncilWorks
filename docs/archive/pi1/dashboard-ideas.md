# Dashboard Ideas (RCM & CCT)

This document captures additional dashboard card ideas to consider implementing.

## Candidates

- Asset Health Index: Composite score per asset class; trend vs last 30/90 days.
- Risk Heatmap: Likelihood × consequence matrix with counts; filter by asset type.
- Compliance KPI: Regulatory checks completed vs required; next audit window.
- Work Order Throughput: Created vs completed, mean time to complete, bottlenecks.
- Cost to Maintain vs Replace: Rolling 12‑month maintenance cost vs replacement.
- Condition Distribution: Histogram of condition ratings (1–5) by asset class.
- Inspection Coverage: Percentage inspected in period; overdue inspections.
- Downtime Tracker: Planned vs unplanned; top assets by downtime.
- Predictive Alerts: Probability of failure in next 30/60/90 days.

## Notes

- Use Australian English, DD/MM/YYYY dates, 24‑hour time, and metric units.
- Prefer shadcn/ui primitives; keep cards accessible and responsive.
