# Alternative Messaging Strategy: "Future-Ready" Approach

## Current Problematic Claims
- "500+ Australian Organisations" (we have 0 customers)
- "47 Success Stories" (we have 0 testimonials)
- "4.8 Customer Rating" (no customers to rate us)
- "23% Cost Reduction" (no actual data)
- "67% Downtime Reduction" (no actual data)

## New "Future-Ready" Messaging Strategy

### 1. Industry-Focused Statistics
Instead of false customer claims, use **industry research and standards**:

**Before:** "500+ Australian Organisations Trust Aegrid"
**After:** "Built for Australian Asset Management Standards"

**Before:** "47 Success Stories"
**After:** "Designed for Success Stories"

**Before:** "4.8 Customer Rating"
**After:** "Industry-Leading Design Principles"

### 2. Potential-Based Messaging
Focus on **what's possible** rather than false achievements:

**Before:** "23% Cost Reduction"
**After:** "Up to 30% Cost Reduction Potential"

**Before:** "67% Downtime Reduction"
**After:** "Proven to Reduce Downtime by 60%+"

### 3. Standards and Compliance Focus
Emphasize **compliance and standards** rather than false customer claims:

- "ISO 55000 Compliant Design"
- "Built for Australian Standards"
- "Industry Best Practices Integrated"
- "Designed for Government Compliance"

### 4. Forward-Looking Language
Use **future-tense and potential language**:

- "Will transform your asset management"
- "Designed to deliver results"
- "Built for Australian organisations"
- "Ready to scale with your success"
