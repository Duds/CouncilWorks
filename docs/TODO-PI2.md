**Status**: ðŸš§ **IN PROGRESS** - E7 Journey-Centric UX Transformation âœ… **COMPLETED**

Last updated: 15/09/2025

## PI2 Vision & Objectives

### Core Vision
Transform Aegrid from a feature-centric platform to a journey-centric asset intelligence system that embodies "The Aegrid Rules" and delivers industry-standard compliance across multiple sectors.

### Strategic Objectives
1. **Journey-Centric UX**: Implement workflow-based navigation aligned with user personas
2. **Industry Compliance**: Achieve comprehensive ISO standards compliance (14224, 55000, 27001, 27002, 31000, 42010, 20547-3, 8000, 15926, 20000, 21500, 9001, 22301)
3. **Graph-Based Asset Model**: Support multiple overlapping hierarchies and tagging
4. **Sector Neutrality**: Refactor language for broader industry applicability
5. **Core Principles**: Implement "The Aegrid Rules" throughout the platform

## The Aegrid Rules - Core North Star

### Rule 1: Every Asset Has a Purpose â†’ Function-Based Anchoring
**"Assets are not just items to be owned or managed; they exist to deliver service, function, or value."**

- Structure assets around what they do (their service purpose), not just where they sit
- Hierarchies or tags should reflect intended function (e.g., mowing, transport, lifting) so value is always visible
- Avoid "miscellaneous" or "other" buckets that obscure purpose

### Rule 2: Match Maintenance to Risk â†’ Criticality-Driven Grouping
**"Not all assets are equal â€” maintenance should be right-sized with RCM-lite to balance risk, cost, and service impact."**

- Asset hierarchy should enable risk-based maintenance by clearly tagging/structuring criticality, failure modes, and service impact
- Allow grouping by condition, risk, and performance, not just asset type or location
- This supports RCM-lite approaches â€” easy to filter assets into "inspect quarterly vs run-to-fail"

### Rule 3: Protect the Critical Few â†’ Visibility of Crown Jewels
**"Focus attention and resources on the assets whose failure would cause the greatest harm to safety, service, or reputation."**

- Hierarchy must make the critical assets stand out from the noise
- Ensure the system can flag and elevate "high consequence" assets in any view (finance, location, engineering)
- Don't bury the vital 10% of assets in a deep tree â€” surface them with tags, dashboards, or dedicated groupings

### Rule 4: Plan for Tomorrow, Today â†’ Flexible, Future-Proof Models
**"Take a forward-looking view of asset decisions to ensure sustainability, resilience, and future service needs are met."**

- Use graph-based or tag-enabled hierarchies that can adapt when organisations, depots, or funding models change
- Avoid hardcoding today's org chart into the structure â€” assets outlive reporting lines
- Enable multiple views (ops, finance, compliance, digital twin) without restructuring

**Note**: Every feature, user story, and epic in PI2 must demonstrate clear alignment with one or more Aegrid Rules. These rules are non-negotiable and serve as our quality gates for all development work.
