# Aegrid Product Backlog - PI3

**Product Increment 3 (PI3) - Resilient Asset Management Implementation**
**Period**: September 2025
**Status**: ðŸš€ **PLANNING** - Comprehensive Aegrid Rules Refactoring & Resilience Implementation

Last updated: 18/09/2025

## ðŸŽ¯ PI3 Vision & Objectives

### Core Vision
Transform Aegrid from traditional asset management to a resilient, antifragile platform that thrives under pressure. Implement "The Aegrid Rules: Resilient Asset Management for Critical Control" throughout the entire system, creating adaptive systems that get stronger when stressed.

### Strategic Objectives
1. **Resilience-First Architecture**: Implement antifragile systems that improve under stress
2. **Signal-Driven Operations**: Build adaptive response capabilities based on real-world signals
3. **Margin-Based Operations**: Implement practical slack for absorbing shocks without losing control
4. **Purpose-Driven Asset Management**: Transform from location-based to function-based asset organization
5. **Dynamic Risk Management**: Replace static risk assessment with adaptive, signal-driven risk management

## The Aegrid Rules - Implementation Framework

### Rule 1: Every Asset Has a Purpose â†’ Function-Based Anchoring
**"Assets are not just items to be owned or managed; they exist to deliver service, function, or value."**

**Implementation Focus**:
- Transform asset organization from location-based to function-based
- Implement critical control mapping for every asset
- Create service purpose visibility throughout the system
- Eliminate "miscellaneous" or "other" asset categories

### Rule 2: Risk Sets the Rhythm â†’ Dynamic Risk-Based Management
**"Not all assets are equal ,maintenance should be right-sized with RCM-lite to balance risk, cost, and service impact."**

**Implementation Focus**:
- Replace static risk assessment with dynamic, signal-driven risk management
- Implement seasonal risk adaptation and weather-based resource allocation
- Create adaptive maintenance scheduling that responds to risk signals
- Build consequence Ã— likelihood risk calculation with real-time updates

### Rule 3: Respond to the Real World â†’ Adaptive Response Systems
**"Plans are guides, not gospel. When conditions, signals, or context change, adapt resources and priorities quickly."**

**Implementation Focus**:
- Implement signal detection and rapid response capabilities
- Create adaptive resource allocation within 24-hour response targets
- Build plan-as-hypothesis management systems
- Implement emergency response protocols and margin deployment

### Rule 4: Operate with Margin â†’ Antifragile Operations
**"Build practical slack so today's actions create tomorrow's resilience. Margin = time, capacity, and materials that let you absorb shocks without losing control."**

**Implementation Focus**:
- Implement margin management systems (time, capacity, material, financial)
- Create antifragile system metrics and monitoring
- Build surge capacity agreements and emergency protocols
- Implement margin effectiveness measurement and optimization
