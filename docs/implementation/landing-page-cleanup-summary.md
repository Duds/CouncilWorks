# Landing Page Cleanup Summary

## üîß **Changes Made**

### **1. Removed "Optimised for Every Device" Section**
- **Deleted**: The entire `MobileOptimizedSection` component (lines 208-251)
- **Reason**: User requested removal of this section
- **Impact**: Reduced page length and removed mobile device showcase content

### **2. Fixed Loading Skeleton Issue**
- **Problem**: A `LazySection` was stuck showing a loading skeleton instead of content
- **Root Cause**: `ROICalculator` component didn't exist - was importing `InteractiveDemo` incorrectly
- **Solution**: Removed the entire ROI Calculator section and its `LazySection` wrapper
- **Result**: Eliminated the stuck loading skeleton that was showing `animate-pulse` placeholders

### **3. Fixed Hero Section Viewport Height**
- **Problem**: Hero section was not taking up full viewport height
- **Root Cause**: Missing `min-h-screen` and flex centering classes
- **Solution**: Added `min-h-screen flex items-center` to hero section
- **Result**: Hero section now properly fills the entire viewport height and centers content vertically

### **4. Fixed Aegrid Rules Cards Height Inconsistency**
- **Problem**: Aegrid Rules cards had different heights due to varying description lengths
- **Root Cause**: Cards didn't have fixed height and content wasn't properly distributed
- **Solution**: Added `h-full flex flex-col` to cards and `mt-auto` to descriptions
- **Result**: All Aegrid Rules cards now have consistent height with descriptions aligned at bottom

### **5. Identified and Temporarily Disabled Phase 3 Components**
- **Components Affecting Page Performance**:
  - `InteractiveProductDemo` - Interactive demo with Aegrid Rules
  - `IndustrySpecificLanding` - Industry-specific solutions showcase
  - `PersonalizedExperience` - User persona-based content
  - `ConversionOptimization` - Conversion tracking and optimization tools
  - `EnterpriseFeatures` - Enterprise-grade feature highlights

- **Action Taken**: Temporarily commented out all Phase 3 components
- **Reason**: These components were taking up space but potentially not rendering properly or causing performance issues

### **6. Cleaned Up Imports**
- **Removed unused imports** for the disabled Phase 3 components
- **Kept essential imports** for components still in use
- **Removed** `ROICalculator` import as the component was non-existent

## üìä **Current Page Structure**

The landing page now has a streamlined structure:

1. **Hero Section** - Core value proposition with Aegrid Rules
2. **Feature Showcase** - Key platform features
3. **ROI Calculator** - Interactive savings calculator
4. **Enhanced Stats Section** - Aegrid Rules in action with particle background
5. **Founder & Aegrid Rules** - Dale Rogers' story and the four rules
6. **Pilot Partnership Journey** - How we work with clients
7. **Value for Every Stakeholder** - Role-specific benefits
8. **FAQ Section** - Common pilot partnership questions
9. **Enterprise Security & Compliance** - Security credentials and compliance
10. **Footer** - Contact information and links
