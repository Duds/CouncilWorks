# Service Concept – CouncilWorks

## Purpose
CouncilWorks is the flagship product of GridWorks, designed to help local governments move beyond static asset registers and complex ERP modules. It provides a dedicated intelligence layer for asset lifecycle management, giving councils practical tools to extend asset life, reduce risk, and demonstrate accountability to their communities.

## Problem Statement
- Councils are responsible for **hundreds of billions of dollars in public assets**, from roads and drains to playgrounds, libraries, EV fleets, and solar farms.  
- Many rely on **fragmented systems**: outdated spreadsheets, legacy ERP modules, or static registers.  
- Audit reports (QAO, VAGO, etc.) show that most councils fall short on **asset planning, risk management, and reporting maturity**.  
- Communities expect **greater transparency** on how their rates are used, but resources are tight.  

The result: **reactive maintenance, inefficient spending, audit risk, and public frustration.**

## Service Proposition
**CouncilWorks delivers proactive, connected asset lifecycle intelligence.**  
It unifies registers, risk models, work orders, inspections, and forecasting in a single SaaS platform built specifically for councils.

### Key Capabilities
1. **Asset Register + GIS**  
   Import assets from ERP/CSV and visualise them spatially with PostGIS integration.  

2. **RCM-lite Templates**  
   Preloaded maintenance models for the top 10 council asset classes (roads, trucks, playgrounds, drains, lighting, parks, etc.).  

3. **Preventive Maintenance Scheduling**  
   Automates work orders based on risk, condition, and lifecycle stage.  

4. **Mobile Inspections (PWA)**  
   Crews log inspections, update condition, and upload photos offline.  

5. **Citizen Report Integration**  
   Issues reported via Snap Send Solve or native portal flow directly into work order queues.  

6. **Risk & Compliance Dashboards**  
   Managers and executives access visual dashboards and export audit-ready packs.  

7. **Forecasting & Renewal Planning**  
   Analytics engine models CapEx/OpEx trade-offs and long-term renewal plans.  

8. **Future Enhancements** (Phase 2+)  
   - Predictive maintenance from IoT/fleet telemetry.  
   - Sustainability/carbon tracking for EV fleets, solar, batteries.  
   - Benchmarking across councils and digital twin integration.

## Service Boundaries
- **Not an ERP**: Works alongside existing finance systems (Civica, TechOne).  
- **Not a CRM**: Focuses on assets, not customer relationships.  
- **Not just reporting**: Operational execution (work orders, inspections) is core.  

---

## Benefits for Councils
### Strategic
- Extend asset life, optimise renewal cycles.  
- Provide clear evidence for funding and audits.  
- Benchmark against other councils.  

### Operational
- Reduce downtime and reactive maintenance.  
- Streamline crew work allocation and inspections.  
- Integrate citizen reporting into workflows.  

### Community
- Improve transparency with "you said / we did" dashboards.  
- Increase safety and service reliability.  
- Support sustainability and climate commitments.

## Service Model
- **Subscription SaaS** – tiered by asset volume, with optional add-ons (citizen reporting, sustainability, AI predictive modules).  
- **Implementation Services** – discovery, data migration, template tailoring, training.  
- **Continuous Updates** – frequent feature releases via secure CI/CD pipeline.  
- **Support** – service desk, knowledge base, customer success managers.  

---

## Service Delivery Approach
- **Discovery Phase** – Import data, configure templates, map workflows.  
- **Pilot Phase** – Run a 12-week trial on one asset class (e.g. fleet or playgrounds).  
- **Proof Phase** – Demonstrate ROI (compliance gains, downtime reduction).  
- **Scale Phase** – Roll out across all asset classes, integrate ERP and citizen channels.  

---

## Expected Outcomes
- Shift councils from **reactive → proactive → predictive** asset management.  
- Reduce liability risk and insurance exposure.  
- Align with ISO 55000, NAMAF, and Local Government Act requirements.  
- Achieve measurable savings per asset lifecycle through renewal optimisation.

## Positioning Statement
**CouncilWorks by GridWorks is the practical, connected platform for managing the civic grid of assets and services.**  
It ensures public infrastructure works better, costs less, and builds trust with the community.
