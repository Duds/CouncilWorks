## Customer Journey Diagrams Created

Six detailed PlantUML customer journey diagrams were created:

1. **Executive Journey** (`executive-journey.puml`) - Strategic asset management workflow
2. **Manager Journey** (`manager-journey.puml`) - Operational asset management workflow
3. **Supervisor Journey** (`supervisor-journey.puml`) - Work coordination workflow
4. **Crew Journey** (`crew-journey.puml`) - Field work execution workflow
5. **Citizen Journey** (`citizen-journey.puml`) - Issue reporting and tracking workflow
6. **Admin Journey** (`admin-journey.puml`) - System administration workflow
7. **Journey Overview** (`journey-overview.puml`) - High-level persona interactions

## Service Blueprint Refinements

The service blueprint was updated to include:

### Enhanced Service Layers
- Added administrators to frontstage users
- Enhanced backstage processes to include critical control enforcement
- Expanded systems to include Citizen Portal
- Improved support layer with help desk and knowledge base
- Enhanced metrics layer with critical control compliance

### Expanded Supporting Processes
- **Team Management**: User role assignment, permission management, crew coordination, skill tracking
- **Import/Export Tools**: Data migration utilities, bulk operations, system integration tools
- **Activity Logging**: Comprehensive audit trails, user activity monitoring, system event tracking

### New Audit Section
Added comprehensive sidebar feature audit with:
- Current implementation status
- Missing features requiring implementation
- Recommended sidebar enhancements
- User experience improvements

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Implement Team Management** - Replace placeholder with functional team coordination
2. **Add Work Order Access** - Consolidate work order management in main sidebar
3. **Implement Help System** - Replace placeholder with integrated knowledge base
4. **Add Activity Logs** - Provide audit trail access from main navigation

### Medium-term Enhancements
1. **SLA Management Dashboard** - Integrate vendor management and contract performance
2. **Critical Controls Interface** - Dedicated critical control management
3. **Sustainability Module** - Environmental impact and green asset management
4. **Enhanced Mobile Integration** - Better visibility of mobile PWA features

### Long-term Strategic Improvements
1. **Vendor Portal** - Comprehensive contractor management interface
2. **Data Management Tools** - Advanced import/export utilities and migration tools
3. **Advanced Analytics** - Predictive maintenance and AI-powered insights

## Conclusion

The audit reveals that CouncilWorks has successfully implemented 60% of the planned sidebar features, with strong coverage of core asset management capabilities. The customer journey diagrams provide clear guidance for user experience improvements and feature prioritisation. The refined service blueprint now better reflects the current implementation state and provides a roadmap for completing the remaining features.

The PlantUML diagrams serve as living documentation that can be used for:
- User experience design decisions
- Feature prioritisation
- Training and onboarding
- System architecture discussions
- Stakeholder communication

This analysis provides a solid foundation for continued development and ensures alignment between the service blueprint and actual implementation.
