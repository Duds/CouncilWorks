# Journey-Centric UX Design Plan for Aegrid

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive plan to transform the Aegrid sidebar from a feature-centric menu to a journey-centric workflow interface that embodies The Aegrid Rules. The plan addresses user persona needs, industry-standard roles, and implements best practices for intuitive navigation while ensuring every interaction supports the resilience-first philosophy.

## Industry Research: Asset Planner vs Scheduler

Based on industry research, both roles exist but serve different functions:

### Asset Planner

- **Focus**: Determines WHAT maintenance work needs to be done
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Develop detailed work plans
  - Ensure necessary resources (personnel, materials) are available
  - Maintain accurate records of planned activities
  - Asset lifecycle planning and renewal forecasting

### Asset Scheduler

- **Focus**: Determines WHEN work will take place and WHO will perform it
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Create and manage maintenance schedules
  - Coordinate with teams to assign tasks
  - Adjust schedules based on resource availability and priorities
  - Work order assignment and crew coordination

**Recommendation**: In Australian local government context, "Asset Planner" is more common and encompasses both planning and scheduling functions. We'll use "Asset Planner" as the primary role.

## Conclusion

This journey-centric approach transforms the Aegrid sidebar from a feature list into an intuitive workflow system that embodies The Aegrid Rules. By grouping related features around resilience principles and implementing page tabs that support critical control management, users can follow natural workflows that align with the resilience-first philosophy.

The proposed structure reduces cognitive load, improves task completion rates, and creates a more professional, enterprise-grade user experience that matches the sophistication of the Aegrid platform. Every navigation decision supports the four core rules:

- **Rule 1 (Every Asset Purpose)**: Navigation emphasizes critical control connections and purpose-driven asset management
- **Rule 2 (Risk Sets Rhythm)**: Risk-based planning and adaptive scheduling are prominently featured
- **Rule 3 (Real-World Response)**: Signal detection and adaptive response capabilities are central to the workflow
- **Rule 4 (Margin Management)**: Margin operations and resilience planning are integrated throughout

This approach ensures that every user interaction reinforces the resilience-first philosophy and supports the transformation from reactive maintenance to proactive risk management.
