## Conclusion

The current Manager Journey implementation provides a solid foundation with core dashboard and monitoring capabilities. However, significant gaps exist in operational execution (work orders, resource assignment) and strategic management (planning, reporting).

**Immediate Action Required**: Implement work order management and resource assignment systems to enable practical asset management operations.

**Strategic Focus**: Develop management reporting and strategic planning capabilities for ISO 55000/55001 compliance.
