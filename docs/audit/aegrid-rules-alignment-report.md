## Detailed Analysis by Aegrid Rule

### Rule 1: Every Asset Has a Purpose ‚úÖ **85/100**

#### **Strengths**
- **Function-Based Organization**: `lib/function-based-org.ts` implements service purpose mapping
- **Critical Control Mapping**: `lib/critical-asset-elevation.ts` connects assets to critical controls
- **API Support**: `/api/assets/service-functions/` endpoint supports purpose-based queries
- **Database Schema**: Asset model includes purpose-driven fields and relationships

#### **Gaps Identified**
- **Missing Service Purpose Field**: Database schema lacks explicit `servicePurpose` field
- **Incomplete Control Mapping**: Not all assets mapped to critical controls
- **Generic Categories**: Asset types still include "OTHER" category (violates rule)

#### **Recommendations**
1. Add `servicePurpose` field to Asset model
2. Implement mandatory control mapping for all assets
3. Remove generic categories and require specific purposes

### Rule 2: Risk Sets the Rhythm ‚ö†Ô∏è **65/100**

#### **Strengths**

## Conclusion

The Aegrid project has a **strong foundation** for implementing the Aegrid Rules, with good architectural decisions and comprehensive ISO compliance. However, **critical gaps** in resilience implementation prevent full alignment with the antifragile philosophy.

The most critical missing piece is the **Resilience Engine** - without this, the system cannot respond to real-world changes, operate with margin, or demonstrate antifragile behavior. This must be implemented immediately to achieve true Aegrid Rules compliance.

With focused effort on the identified gaps, the project can achieve **90%+ alignment** with the Aegrid Rules within 12 weeks, transforming it from a traditional asset management system into a truly resilient, antifragile platform.
