- Code linting and formatting
- Test execution before commit
- Vulnerability blocking (high severity)

**Scripts Added:**

```bash
npm run security:audit    # Run security audit
npm run security:fix       # Fix security vulnerabilities
npm run security:scan     # Run comprehensive security scan
npm run lint:fix          # Fix linting issues
```

### D) Comprehensive Security Report ‚úÖ

**Files Created:**

- `scripts/generate-security-report.ts` - Security report generator
- `docs/security/security-report.md` - Generated security report

**Features:**

- Automated security analysis
- Vulnerability detection and categorization
- Security score calculation
- Detailed recommendations
- Exportable security reports

**Usage:**

```bash
npm run security:report
```

### E) Container Security Scanning ‚úÖ

**Files Created:**

- `scripts/container-security-scan.sh` - Container security scanning script
- `docs/security/container-security-report.md` - Container security report

**Features:**

- Docker image security analysis
- Snyk container scanning
- Trivy vulnerability scanning
- Security best practices validation
- Automated report generation

**Usage:**

```bash
npm run security:container
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Tools Integration

### Snyk MCP Integration

**Authentication:** ‚úÖ Configured and authenticated
**SCA Scanning:** ‚úÖ Dependency vulnerability scanning
**Container Scanning:** ‚úÖ Docker image security analysis
**Code Scanning:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires Snyk Code license (organization 'duds' not enabled)

### Additional Security Tools

- **Husky:** Pre-commit hooks
- **ESLint:** Code quality and security linting
- **Prettier:** Code formatting
- **npm audit:** Built-in vulnerability scanning
- **Trivy:** Container vulnerability scanning (optional)

## üìä Security Metrics

### Current Security Status

- **Dependencies:** ‚úÖ No vulnerabilities found
- **Container:** ‚úÖ No vulnerabilities found
- **Code Quality:** ‚úÖ All linting checks pass
- **Authentication:** ‚úÖ NextAuth.js properly configured
- **Authorization:** ‚úÖ Role-based access control implemented

### Known Issues

1. **xlsx Package Vulnerability:**
   - Severity: Medium
   - CVE: GHSA-4r6h-8v6p-xvw6, GHSA-5pgg-2g8v-p4x9
   - Mitigation: Input validation, file size limits, type validation
   - Recommendation: Replace with more secure alternative

## üîß Security Configuration

### Environment Variables Required

```bash
# Snyk Configuration
SNYK_TOKEN=your_snyk_token_here

# NextAuth Configuration
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_nextauth_secret
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Database Security
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
COSMOS_DB_CONNECTION_STRING=your_cosmos_connection
```

### GitHub Secrets Required

- `SNYK_TOKEN` - Snyk API token for security scanning
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` - NextAuth.js secret for session management

## üìã Security Checklist

### Pre-deployment Security Checks

- [ ] Run `npm run security:audit`
- [ ] Run `npm run security:report`
- [ ] Run `npm run security:container`
- [ ] Verify all tests pass
- [ ] Check linting results
- [ ] Review security dashboard

### Ongoing Security Maintenance
