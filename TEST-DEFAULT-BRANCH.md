# Test Default Branch Workflow

This PR tests the new default branch workflow with `develop` as the default branch.

## Changes Made
- ✅ Changed default branch from `main` to `develop`
- ✅ Applied branch protection rules to all branches
- ✅ Updated workflow configurations
- ✅ Enhanced automated fix systems

## Testing
- [ ] PR targets `develop` by default (new default branch)
- [ ] Branch protection rules are active
- [ ] CI/CD workflows trigger correctly
- [ ] Automated systems work with new default

## Expected Behavior
This PR should:
1. **Target `develop`** automatically (since it's now the default branch)
2. **Require 1 review** (develop branch protection)
3. **Run CI checks** (test, security)
4. **Deploy to staging** when merged

## Branch Protection Summary
- **`develop`** (default): 1 review required, test + security checks
- **`main`** (production): 2 reviews + code owner review required
- **`automated-review`**: 1 review required, automated review checks

This demonstrates the improved development workflow with `develop` as the integration branch.
